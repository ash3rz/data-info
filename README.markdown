# data-info

data-info is a platform for hosting Services written in Clojure; it's intended to
be the replacement for the Mule instance that used to run inside the Discovery
Environment web application.

*Important Note:* All of the services that used to run inside Mule now run
inside data-info instead.  The Mule services no longer exist.
